## Book Review #1: Undying Courage: The story of Bagha Jatin

## Some background story
From the past few months (even before the lockdown started), I am taken by a keen fascination with the history of West Bengal. I felt particularly interested in the early history of Bengal snd focussed more on the era before and during the bristish occupancy. It was during this period that I delved deeper into the life of this legendary revolutionary named Jatindranath Mukherjee a.k.a Bagha Jatin and lovingly referred to as "Jatin da". Every bengali child comes across the stories of Jatin in one form or another. Luckily, I found this book in the massive main library at the UIUC. This book is written by Dr. Prithwindra Mukherjee, the grandson of Jatindranath Mukherjee. The author being the grandson of Jatin da certainly adds much more credibility to the facts and the instances described in the book.

## The book & reading experience
I throughly enjoyed reading this book. Agreed that reading biographies requires certain inclination towards the subject matter but I still enjoyed the contents of the book. The written material is interspersed with pictures of Jatin which makes reading it more interesting  and helps in connecting with the stories and the incidents more deeply. This book, which I found in the UIUC main library, was published in 1992 and so the pages and the font style bore an old worldly charm.

## The central character: Jatindranath Mukherjee
Born in 1879, Jatindranath Mukherjee was a freedom fighter with charismatic and magnetic personality. There are numerous references oulining his contributions to the Indian freedom struggle but I will focus mostly on his personality and his attitude from which the mordern generation or frankly anyone can learn a lot.
